Nuclear Ram Jet powered RamJet, (facts)while the real/proposed missile itself was never tested two suitable nuclear ramjets were built and test run, if only for a matter of seconds, well it's not exactly healthy, it makes a PN Nuke look like a pocket warmer .(description)  This 19meter long missile carries 12 large sub munition type warheads, while quite accurate this device is not about precision,  the main purpose of this device is to make a mess and really upset peoples plans for the week.

	description = #autoLOC_SMIndustries_6000069	//#autoLOC_SMIndustries_6000069 = After years of fumbling around  just out of radar range due to the planets curvature, Kerbins naval engineers started mounting radars on sticks, it wasn't long before they wanted a stick that got bigger. Early trials of fastening radars to large potted trees, while it was found to be very restful for the crews , engineers decided that waiting 20 years for the radar to get higher was not an option and so after many trials arrived at a mechanical stick that gets bigger.
But seriously this elevating locking radar can seriously increase your chances of getting in the first shot , being able to target other vessels while they are unable to obtain a radar lock. The unit also includes full IR targeting capabilities and camera unit making it a very difficult unit to jam

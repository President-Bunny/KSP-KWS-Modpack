Thank you for reading
With reference to the included robotic parts, in the previous version 0.9.13.99 they were broken.  I have recompiled a development copy of the original Infernal robotics , which was what these parts were designed to use. and functionality has been restored  To use you will need a copy of the last release from  https://github.com/meirumeiru/InfernalRobotics/releases.  once installed remove the active struts and sequencer dlls and the existing infernal robotics plugin  and replace with the compiled for 1.4.x plugin available at this link      Source code for this is recompile is available  https://github.com/SpannerMonkey/InfernalRobotics
